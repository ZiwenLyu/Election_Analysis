## Overview of Election Audit
This project is to assist Colorado Board of Elections in tabulated election audits in U.S. Congressional precincts in Colorado. There are three counties Araphahoe, Denver, and Jefferson and three candidates Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Anthony Doane in Colorado. Specifically, we will deliver the total votes cast, total votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes each candidate won, the winner, each county's vote turnover, and the county with the largest turnover. We used Python to create a template which automate the process of analysis and applicable to other similar election audits including senatorial and local elections.
